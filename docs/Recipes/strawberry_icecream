Ingredients
1/2 cup coconut cream
1/2 cup coconut or almond milk
Juice from 1/2 of a large orange
3 medjool dates, pitted
1 Tablespoon vanilla extract
2 cups frozen strawberries
1 cup of ice cubes

Instructions
Put the coconut cream, milk, orange juice, dates, and vanilla in a high-powered blender and blend until smooth.
Add the strawberries and ice cubes. If your blender pitcher has measurements on the side, fill it with strawberries to the 3 cup mark and the ice to the 4 cup mark.
If your blender has presets, use the ice cream setting to blend everything together. You may have to run the preset more than once and push all of the frozen bits down to the bottom between blending. If your blender has a hard time getting everything smooth, add 1/4 cup more milk.
Serve.
