# Irish Stew
[original](https://www.meanwhileinireland.com/how-to-make-a-good-feckin-irish-stew-recipe/)

## Ingedients
- Two tablespoons vegetable oil
- One pound of mutton or lamb cutlets, bones removed, cut into two-inch (five cm) chunks
- Two pounds of potatoes, peeled and cut into quarters
- One cup of onion, roughly chopped
- One cup of leeks, cleaned and finely sliced
- One cup of carrots, roughly chopped
- Two tablespoons of plain flour
- One and a half pints of dark beef stock
- Optional: Two or three cabbage leaves, thinly sliced
- Salt and pepper to taste


## Instructions
- Gather the ingredients. Heat the oven to 350°f (180°c).
- In a large frying pan, heat half the oil until hot but not smoking. Add half the lamb pieces and brown all over by turning in the hot oil.
- Remove the lamb with tongs and place them in a casserole dish.
- Cover with half of the potatoes, onion, leeks, and carrots
- Add the remaining oil to the frying pan and heat. Add the remaining lamb and brown all over as before and add to the casserole.
- Cover with the remaining potatoes, onion, leeks, and carrots.
- Add the flour to the still-hot frying pan and stir well to soak up any fat and juices. Cook on a gentle heat for three minutes.
- Add the stock a ladle at a time and mix until you have a thick, lump-free sauce.
- Pour this sauce over the lamb and vegetables.
- Add the remaining stock to the casserole dish, cover with a tight-fitting lid, and cook in the preheated oven for one hour.
- Add the cabbage (if using), replace the lid, and cook for another hour.
- Check from time to time to make sure the stock hasn’t reduced too much. If it has, add a little boiling water.
- The meat and vegetables should always be covered by liquid. If the sauce is too runny at the end, you can always cook a little longer with the lid removed.
- Season with salt and pepper to taste, serve piping hot, and enjoy.
