### Citrus Tips
- There are a few ways to maximize the amount of juice when squeezing citrus.
- Bring the fruit to room temperature before juicing. This allows for the cell walls to soften and the juice to flow more freely. (You can microwave the citrus for 20 seconds for quicker results.)
- Roll the limes or lemons on the counter using the palm of your hand; this will also help soften the fruit and make them easier to squeeze.
- Use a handheld citrus juicer; this tool will maximize the amount of liquid the fruit will yield. If you don't have one, you can use a fork, making sure to move it back and forth inside the flesh to release as much juice as possible.
