## Ingredients
### For the meatballs:
- 1 ½ lbs ground lamb (paleo diet: lean meat)
- 1 tsp salt (paleo diet: sea salt)
- ½ tsp cumin
- ½ tsp fenugreek
- ½ tsp garlic powder
- 1 tsp ground ginger
- 1 Tbsp garbanzo bean flour (paleo diet: coconut flour)
- 1 egg beaten

### For the curry sauce:
- 1 onion medium, chopped
- 1 jalapeno large, minced
- 1 ½ Tbsp olive oil
- 1 tsp ground ginger
- 2 garlic cloves minced
- 1 Tbsp curry mild
- ¾ tsp cayenne pepper
- ½ Tbsp garam masala
- 2 cups vegetable broth
- 6 Roma tomatoes diced
- 1 Tbsp tomato paste
- 3 Tbsp cilantro chopped
- ⅓ cup cashews ground into a paste*
- 1 cup plain yogurt + 2 Tbsp. for thickening (paleo diet: coconut milk yogurt)
- 1 dash allspice
* Place cashews in a small food processor with about 1 Tbsp olive oil. Grind thoroughly until a chunky paste is formed.

## Instructions
### Make the Lamb Kofta:
- Preheat oven to 350°F.
- For the meatballs: Mix the spices into the garbanzo bean flour. Add to the meat and mix thoroughly. Add the egg and combine into the meat mixture. If you have a medium cookie scooper, form balls and place on a large Pyrex dish. Bake for about 15 minutes in the oven. You don't have to cook the meatballs all the way through since the meatballs will finish cooking in the curry sauce.
### Make the Curry Sauce:
- In a Dutch oven on medium heat saute the onions, jalapeno and garlic in the oil until onions are translucent. Add the Roma tomatoes and allow this to simmer for about 20 minutes while breaking down with a wooden spoon. While simmering you can make the cashew paste.
- Add the vegetable broth, tomato paste, ginger, curry and cayenne.
- Add the cashew paste and stir well until mixed in.
- Add the meatballs to the sauce.
- Allow the sauce to thicken for about 10-15 minutes on low heat.
- Add the garam masala. Stir and slowly add the 2 Tbsp. of yogurt stirring until it is all mixed in.
- Cook for an additional 10 minutes. Add dash of allspice. Add the cilantro.
- Serve hot over rice or with naan bread and yogurt on the side.
