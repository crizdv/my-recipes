## INGREDIENTS
 
- 600 g chicken (4 chicken breasts)
- ½ lemon juiced
- 2 tablespoon coconut yogurt
- 1 teaspoon cayenne pepper
- 1 teaspoon paprika
- 1 teaspoon coriander
- ½ teaspoon cumin
- ½ teaspoon turmeric
- ¼ teaspoon cinnamon
- 3 garlic cloves crushed

- 1 teaspoon natural red food colour optional
- 1 pinch salt

## INSTRUCTIONS
 
- Mix together all the marinade ingredients and put the chicken in.
- Marinate overnight or for at least 4 hours.
- Cook the chicken under the grill or in a frying pan until fully cooked.

### NOTES
- If using chicken breasts, butterflying them first will give a larger surface area so the marinade can flavour them more.
