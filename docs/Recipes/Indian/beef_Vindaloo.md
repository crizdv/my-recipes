### BEEF VINDALOO:
- Place beef in a large bowl. Add vindaloo paste. Toss to coat. Cover and marinate in the refrigerator for at least an hour or overnight if possible.
- Meanwhile heat oil in a large frying pan over medium-high heat. Add onions, and sauté, stirring occasionally, for about 2-3 minutes or until the onions are soft and translucent. Add chopped garlic, and sauté, stirring, for 1 minute or until fragrant.
- Add ground turmeric, red chili powder, tomatoes, tomato paste and vinegar. Sauté, stirring occasionally, for 2-3 minutes or until the tomatoes break down and mushy.
- Add beef and sugar. Season with salt. Stir to combine. Cook, stirring occasionally, for about 10 minutes.
- Pour in water. Stir.
- Bring to the boil. Reduce heat to medium. Cover and simmer for about an hour or until beef is cooked through and the sauce is thick.
- (Alternatively, you can cook this in a pressure cooker. After step 6, transfer the curry to the cooker. Cover with the lid. Place the whistle on top and cook for about 7-8 whistles)

#### Make this in instant pot:

Turn on instant pot. In sauté mode, heat oil, and sauté onion. Add garlic and sauté for 1 minute. Add ground turmeric, chili powder, tomatoes, tomato paste and vinegar. Sauté for 2-3 minutes or until tomatoes turn mushy. Add marinated beef and sugar. Add water. Season with salt. Stir to combine. Put the lid on the instant pot. Select manual mode. Set the timer for 20 minutes. When done, let the pressure release naturally for 15 minutes. Remove lid. If there’s too much sauce in the curry, you can turn on the saute mode, and cook a little longer to thicken it.

#### Make this in slow cooker:

After step 5, transfer the curry to slow cooker. Cover with lid. Cook for 4 hours on high or 8 hours on low.

#### NOTES
- You can substitute cider vinegar with rice vinegar or white vinegar.
