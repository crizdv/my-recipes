Pork Stew Tips And Tricks
Prefer beef over pork? Follow this recipe but substitute beef stew meat for the pork.
To make this with chicken, reduce cooking time to 10 minutes for thighs and 12-14 minutes for chicken breasts depending on thickness. Cut up the chicken after cooking. 
For best results, use a well-marbled piece of meat and not a lean cut.
To reduce the spiciness, lessen the amount of chilis you use.
