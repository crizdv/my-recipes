How to prepare Homemade Worcestershire Sauce
- The first thing we will do is to crush the garlic and the onion well, if you do not have a chopper you can do it perfectly by hand using a knife.
- Then place the garlic and the onion in a pot on medium heat and sauté a little, add the coconut aminos, the mustard, the pepper, the cinnamon, the cloves, the molasses, the white wine and the salt.
- Stir so all the ingredients can be well-integrated and add the grated ginger tip.
- Meanwhile, we crush the anchovies in a mortar, along with the curry and dilute it in some water before pouring it into the pot with the rest of the mixture.
- We lower the heat and cook for about 20 minutes to reduce it while stirring, thus preventing it from sticking.
- Finally, we strain the sauce and pour it into a glass container, let it stand at room temperature for a minimum of two weeks, stirring it several times during this period.
