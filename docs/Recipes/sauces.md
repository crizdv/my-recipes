How to prepare Homemade Worcestershire Sauce
- The first thing we will do is to crush the garlic and the onion well, if you do not have a chopper you can do it perfectly by hand using a knife.
- Then place the garlic and the onion in a pot on medium heat and sauté a little, add the coconut aminos, the mustard, the pepper, the cinnamon, the cloves, the molasses, the white wine and the salt.
- Stir so all the ingredients can be well-integrated and add the grated ginger tip.
- Meanwhile, we crush the anchovies in a mortar, along with the curry and dilute it in some water before pouring it into the pot with the rest of the mixture.
- We lower the heat and cook for about 20 minutes to reduce it while stirring, thus preventing it from sticking.
- Finally, we strain the sauce and pour it into a glass container, let it stand at room temperature for a minimum of two weeks, stirring it several times during this period.

# Lousiana hot sauce
[original](https://www.chilipeppermadness.com/chili-pepper-recipes/hot-sauces/homemade-louisiana-hot-sauce/)

## Ingredients
1 pound red chili peppers chopped (use cayenne, tabasco, red jalapeno or others)
1 quart unchlorinated water (for fermented version only)
3 tablespoons salt (for the non-fermented version, use only 1/2 to 1 teaspoon salt, to your preference)
½-1 cup white wine vinegar to your preference

## Instructions
### FOR THE FERMENTED VERSION
- First, ferment the chili peppers. Chop the peppers then pack them into a jar, leaving at least 1 inch of head space. The peppers may rise a bit when fermenting.
- Next, mix 1 quart unchlorinated water with 3 tablespoons sea salt. Pour just enough brine over the peppers to cover them, pressing them down a bit as you go. It is important to keep the peppers covered with brine to avoid spoilage. Check this daily.
- Screw on the lid and set the jar away from direct sunlight to ferment for at least 1 week. Ideal temperatures are between 55-75 degrees F. The most active fermentation period is between 1-2 weeks, so be sure to monitor it during this time. “Burp” the jars often by unscrewing the lid a bit to let out some of the accumulating gases. Or, use an airlock or membrane for easier fermenting. See our page, “How to Make Fermented Pepper Mash”, for further instruction.
- After 1-2 weeks, the fermenting activity will diminish and the brine will turn cloudy and taste acidic.
- Pour the fermented peppers, including brine, into a pot along with the vinegar. Bring to a quick boil. Reduce heat and simmer for 15 minutes. Alternatively, you can strain out the fermented peppers and discard the brine, then boil the peppers with 1 cup vinegar and 1/2-1 teaspoon salt. Some people prefer to use the brine.
- Cool slightly then add to a food processor and process until smooth.
- Strain the mixture to remove the solids. Pour into hot sauce bottles and enjoy.

### FOR THE NON-FERMENTED VERSION
- Add only the chili peppers, 1 cup vinegar and 1 teaspoon salt to a pot and bring to a quick boil. Be sure you are only using 1 teaspoon of salt.
- Reduce heat and simmer for 10 minutes to soften everything up.
- Cool slightly then add to a food processor and process until smooth. If it is too thick, add water a tablespoon at a time and process until smooth.
- Strain the mixture to remove the solids. Pour into hot sauce bottles and enjoy.

## Another louisana hot sauce
### Ingredients
- 1 pound red chili peppers use cayenne, tabasco, red jalapeno or others
- 1/2-1 teaspoon salt or to your personal taste
- ½-1 cup white wine vinegar to your preference

### Instructions
- Roughly chop the chili peppers and add them to a pot with the salt and vinegar.
- Bring to a quick boil, then reduce heat and simmer for 15 minutes.
- Cool, then add to a food processor. Process until smooth.
- Strain the solids out through a strainer and discard (or keep them for dehydrating – they make great seasonings).
- Pour into bottles and use as desired.

### Notes
- Makes about 2 cups of sauce or so.
- For storage: Vinegar affects acidity levels. Homemade sauces should be kept at 4.0 ph or below to keep longer term. If your hot sauce is not acidic enough, add more vinegar or citrus to bring the ph down. Keep in the fridge for freshness and longer keeping. You can also bottle your sauces with proper procedures.
