CRISPY BAKED CHICKEN WINGS RECIPE – STEP BY STEP
- First, remove the wing tips and separate the wings. Like so. I like to save the tips in the freezer for making chicken stock.
- Pat the wings as dry as you can get them. This will help with the crispiness. I use paper towels.
- Next, set the wings into a large bowl and season with baking powder, salt, and your preferred seasonings. Toss to get them nice and coated.
- The baking powder helps with the crispiness. For extra dryness, cover the wings and refrigerate them overnight to let even more moisture evaporate.
- Next, set your wings onto a baking sheet. You can line the tray with aluminum foil, parchment paper, or use a silicone mat. Another option is to bake them on a wire baking rack set atop a baking sheet. This will allow the rendered fats to drip through and pool below. The racks are difficult to clean, though.
- I usually just use my silicone mat and am very happy with the results.
- Preheat your oven to 120 degrees C. Set the wings onto a lightly oiled baking sheet and bake for 30 minutes. Flip the wings.
- Increase the oven temperature to 220 degrees C and bake the wings another 30 minutes, or until the wings are cooked through and the skins are nice and crispy. If you’d like, you can hit them with the broiler for a couple minutes for an extra blast of crispiness.
- if using forced fan bake only 15 minutes, check, then maybe 3 more minutes
- BOOM! Done! Crispy baked wings! I love them. So wonderfully golden brown.
- Serve as is, or toss them with your favorite wing sauce. Try my Homemade Buffalo Sauce Recipe. It rocks!
